## [Zhen Li]((https://github.com/icemansina)), [Yukang Gan](https://github.com/ganyk)

This code is related to our paper "LSTM-CF: Unifying Context Modeling and Fusion with LSTMs for RGB-D Scene Labeling" accepted by ECCV2016.

Here, we add demos to illustrate scene labeling results at different indoor scenes, which are located in Demo folder.

For test example prototxt, please refer to the SUNRGBD/SUNRGBD_test.prototxt

For the pretrained model, please download through https://goo.gl/DrOSZv
